# Musical Thoughts, Problems & (hopefully) Solutions

An assortment of thoughts related to music and playing the piano.

##### Meta-Notes

* The "title" of each note has the format "(date) <problem/thought/question>". The date component refers to the date the
  problem/thought/question popped up and does *not* imply the thought process/answer below the title was reached in one
  day. In fact, it is usually the case that the thought process/answer that is developed underneath the title was
  reached over multiple days.

* It feels as though the metacarpophalangeal joint of the left hand is *very* weak on my left hand (especially around
  fingers 4 & 5) and this is causing me to "not trust" allowing the weight of my arm to "fall into the muscles"
  surrounding the metacarpophalangeal joint.
