# Musical Thoughts, Problems & (hopefully) Solutions

An assortment of thoughts related to music and playing the piano.

##### Meta-Notes

* The "title" of each note has the format "(date) <problem/thought/question>". The date component refers to the date the
  problem/thought/question popped up and does *not* imply the thought process/answer below the title was reached in one
  day. In fact, it is usually the case that the thought process/answer that is developed underneath the title was
  reached over multiple days.

#### ( 2022-10-02 ): Major, Minor, Diminished & Augmented Triads and their relationship to Scales

* Major triads:
    * Equation: $\text{ root } + 4\left(\text{semitones}\right) + 3\left(\text{semitones}\right)$
    * Notation: Capitalized roman numeral (e.g. $I, IV, V$)
* Minor triads:
    * Equation = $\text{ root } + 3\left(\text{semitones}\right) + 4\left(\text{semitones}\right)$
    * Notation: Lowercase roman numeral (e.g. $i, iv, v$)
* Diminished triads:
    * Equation: $\text{ root } + 3\left(\text{semitones}\right) + 3\left(\text{semitones}\right)$
    * Notation: Lowercase roman numeral *with a degree symbol or a "dim" in the superscript*  (e.g. $i^\circ, iv^\circ, v^\circ$ or $i^{dim}, iv^{dim}, v^{dim}$)
* Augmented triads:
    * Equation: $\text{ root } + 4\left(\text{semitones}\right) + 4\left(\text{semitones}\right)$
    * Notation: Lowercase roman numeral *with a "x" symbol or a "aug" in the superscript*  (e.g. $i^x, iv^x, v^x$ or $i^{aug}, iv^{aug}, v^{aug}$)

#### ( 2022-08-10 ): A Weak Metacarpophalangeal Joint of the Left Hand

* It feels as though the metacarpophalangeal joint of the left hand is *very* weak on my left hand (especially around
  fingers 4 & 5) and this is causing me to "not trust" allowing the weight of my arm to "fall into the muscles"
  surrounding the metacarpophalangeal joint.
